Distribute.exe
===============

Before you run the Distributer make sure that you have mapped
\\Tldc1\ResortP\ to the R: drive.

You can run Distribute.exe directly from this server folder (so you will use always
the newest version) or use the shortcut Distribute (copy it to your desktop),
simpy by double clicking it.

FYI: I also copied the source file distribute.py in the installation directory, so
your old link (using your locally installed python interpreter) should also work.
