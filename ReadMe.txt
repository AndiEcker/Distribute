Distribute.exe
===============

Before you run Distribute make sure that you have access to all the needed folders on the network.

You can run Distribute.exe directly from this server folder (so you will use always
the newest version) or use the shortcut Distribute (copy it to your desktop),
simply by double clicking it.

FYI: I also copied the source file distribute.py in the installation directory, so
your old link (using your locally installed python interpreter) should also work.
